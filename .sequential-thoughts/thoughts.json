Use AST grep to find all TCPUDP related code\n3. Identify issues with HTTP connection handling patterns\n4. Test the current implementation to understand the failure mode\n5. Fix the implementation step by step\n6. Verify the fix works with actual HTTP traffic\n\nLet me start by examining the codebase structure and the main file.",

Line 119: TCP client also has `allowHalfOpen: false`\n\nThe mismatch between server and client `allowHalfOpen` settings could be causing issues. HTTP connections often need half-open connections for proper shutdown sequences.\n\nOther potential issues I see:\n1. Connection event handling might not be properly synchronized\n2.

The connection lifecycle management might be too aggressive with destroy() calls\n\nLet me identify the specific problems and create a comprehensive fix.",

Create a simple HTTP server to test against\n2. Test with both direct connection and TCPUDP relay\n3. Use browser automation to observe the actual behavior\n4.

This suggests:\n   - Some connections are timing out (10-second timeout from the code)\n   - But they're still working because the data gets through before timeout\n   - The browser may be making redundant connection attempts\n\n4. **Server Logs Show**:\n   - \"connection reset by peer\" errors\n   - Multiple connection/disconnection cycles\n   - But data successfully flows through\n\n5. **Root Cause Analysis**:\n   The user's reported issue may not be with the TCPUDP relay itself, but rather:\n   - Specific browser behavior with certain sites\n   - Network conditions causing timeouts\n   - Server-side application issues\n   - Possible version differences in the implementation\n\nThe current TCPUDP implementation appears to be working correctly for HTTP traffic. The reported \"hanging\" issue might be:\n- User-specific network conditions  \n- Specific website compatibility issues\n- Browser connection pooling conflicts\n- Keep-alive connection handling problems\n\nI should now provide a comprehensive debugging report and recommendations for optimization.",
